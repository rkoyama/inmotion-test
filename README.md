# InmotionTest

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 13.1.2.

Feature 1 - Display WordPress Posts
The application should display the most recent 20 posts from the REST API on this
WordPress site: http://wordpress.org/news/wp-json/ . The post should be displayed in an
Angular Material table. The columns of the table should be id, slug, status, title, and creation
date. When a user clicks on a table row, the application should display a link to the post and
the rendered post content.

Feature 2 - Google Maps Integration
This feature should interface with the Google Maps API. This feature should accept user
input and render a map displaying some data. The user input and visual produced is your
preference. You may pull additional APIâ€™s to produce your map.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
